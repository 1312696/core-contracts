# Voting Contract

The purpose of this contract is for people to vote on the next reset height for the network that the
contract is deployed on. Anyone can submit a proposal but only stakeholders can vote. Once over 2/3 of total
stake in an epoch has voted on a proposal, the proposed height becomes final and the voting is closed.
